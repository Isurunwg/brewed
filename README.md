# Brewed — High-End Scrollytelling Coffee Experience

This project is a premium, interactive landing page for **Brewed**, a modern coffee brand, built with a focus on smooth scroll-linked animations that tell the lifecycle story of coffee—from raw cherry to a beautifully crafted latte.

The core feature is a **scroll-triggered image sequence** rendered on an HTML5 canvas at 60fps for silky smooth performance, visualizing each coffee transformation stage:

- Red coffee cherry  
- Roasted coffee bean  
- Finely ground coffee powder  
- Freshly brewed espresso  
- Latte with custom foam art  

Built using the latest **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, the site leverages **Framer Motion** for precise scroll animations and transitions.

## Key Highlights
- Full-screen canvas animation synchronized with scroll progress  
- Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile  
- Elegant visual style using a rich emerald green background (#00735C) and premium typography (Playfair Display + Inter)  
- Text narrative overlays guide users through the coffee journey in a storytelling style  
- Preloader with a progress bar to ensure smooth image sequence loading  

This project demonstrates advanced use of React, canvas rendering, and animation libraries to deliver a **world-class, award-worthy** web experience.
